# kubedownscaler

Scales down Kubernetes Deployments and StatefulSets to 0 replicas, keeps note of the number
of replicas in annotations, and scales everything back up to the original number of replicas.

Can operate on a single namespace, or the entire cluster.

Ideal for performing a controlled shutdown, maintenance, etc.

Uses whatever context your local `kubectl` has.

## Install

```sh
pip install kubedownscaler
```

## Use

Either `-d|--down` or `-u|--up` must be specified.

```
usage: kubectl downscale [-h] (-d | -u) [--dry-run] [-n NAMESPACE] [--deployments | --no-deployments]
               [--statefulsets | --no-statefulsets]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --down            scale down cluster resources
  -u, --up              scale up to restore state
  --dry-run             don't actually scale anything
